# Harnessing-higher-dimensional-fluctuations-in-an-information-engine
Python codes employed for the numerical calculations in the paper "Harnessing higher-dimensional fluctuations in an information engine", from A. Patr√≥n Castro, J. Bechhoefer and D. A. Sivak.

1) "output_power-2D.py" generates the data ("data-output_power-2D") for the output power in 2D as a function of the sampling frequency, as shown in Figure 3 from the main text. The numerical recipe is explained in section IV from the Supplemental Material.
   
3) "threshold-code.py" generates the data for the output power in 2D as a function of the threshold R in the transverse degrees of freedom, in the high-sampling frequency limit, as shown in Figure 2 from the Supplemental Material (Figure 4 from the arXiv version). The numerical recipe is explained in section V from the Supplemental Material.
